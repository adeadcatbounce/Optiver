This is the code for solving, Optiver : Trading at the Close (Kaggle) competition. I use gradient boost (LightGbm) to solve this problem. The code ingests the training dataset,
develops features, fits a LightGBM regressor to the dataset and makes predictions on the dataset. The feature importance plot is shown below. Then the code evaluates the quality of predictions by using statistical metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE and R_Squared). Finally, the code makes predictions on the test dataset
